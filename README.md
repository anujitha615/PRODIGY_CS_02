# PRODIGY_CS_02
Developed Pixel Manipulation for image Encryption, which is used to encrypt the images from being modified with any malicious script.
As part of the Internship from the Prodigy Infotech, I have developed a protection technique for the image from being embedding the malicious script inside the image which may harm the device and stole the datas which include in our device, so this technique help us to encrypt the image with a password thus we can ensure the security of the image.

Steps to encrypt and decrypt the image
  Encrypt
  
1. Run the code and enter the option "encrypt"
2. Enter the path to the image which is to be encrypt.
3. Enter the output file name with .bin extension (eg,. encrypt.bin)
4. Enter the password to protect the image.

   Decrypt

1. Run the code and enter the option "decryt"
2. Enter the path to the file which is encrypted already
3. Enter the output file name (eg,. decrypt.jpg)
4. Enter the password which is used to encrypt.
